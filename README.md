ðŸ§  Your Tasks
Identify and fix the bug.
Explain what the issue was and how you investigated it , this be included in a README.

#Solution:
1. I discovered that the issue with the handleSubmit function is that the e.preventDefault is being called as a property instead of a function hence this won't carry out its intended action
2. The button type is being declared as 'button' instead of 'submit' and that makes it behave just as a generic button instead of a button within a form
